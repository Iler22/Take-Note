## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a back end application that would connect to the front end and render information saved and removed information deleted. To do this a server was created with routes to the note taker home page and a further page where notes could be created, displayed or deleted. A further route was created for the Api which would save information via JSON with a unique id which was required to be able to delete any notes a user no longer needs.
